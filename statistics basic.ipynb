    "a) Reduced Bias: Random sampling minimizes the risk of bias, ensuring that each member of the population has an equal chance of being selected. This helps to avoid systematic errors that can skew results.   \n",

    "b) Representative Sample: A randomly selected sample is more likely to be representative of the population, capturing the diversity and variability within the group.   \n",

    "\n",
    "a) Simple Random Sampling: Each individual has an equal chance of being selected.   \n",
